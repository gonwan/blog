1. QSkin: [http://code.google.com/p/qskin/](http://code.google.com/p/qskin/) QSkin is a framework for easier skinning Windows GUI applications. It uses hook technologies, so applications can apply a skin with almost no changes. The initial 'Q' comes from my last name. :)

2. QAnsiEditor: [http://code.google.com/p/qansieditor/](http://code.google.com/p/qansieditor/) QAnsiEditor is a program to edit Ansi graphics. It aims to run on multiple platforms base on Qt library.

I will start to code the 2nd project first. Hope I can update it daily. Release early, release often. =.=
