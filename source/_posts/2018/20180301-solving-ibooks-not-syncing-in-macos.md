As a note here:

Go to `Menu` --> `Store` --> `Check for Available Downloads`, to refresh your iBooks login manually. Also make sure the iCloud option for iBooks is enabled in settings.

**Updated July 4, 2022**: On MacOS 12, Go to `Settings` --> `Apple ID` ---> `iCloud Drive`, disable and re-enable the iBooks sync. If this does not work, logout and re-login the Apple ID.
