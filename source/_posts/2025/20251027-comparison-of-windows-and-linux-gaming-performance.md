In this post, I will compare gaming performance under Windows and Linux, with 5 games on my Lenovo Ideapad(Xiaoxin in Chinese version) laptop.

### 1. Environment
- Hardware
  - CPU: AMD 7840HS (Zen4)
  - GPU: AMD 780M iGPU (RDNA3) with 8G vRAM setup in UEFI
  - Memory: 24G (32G total, 8G is assigned to iGPU in UEFI)
- Windows 11 25H2
  - AMD graphic driver 2025.9.1 (latest)

- Linux Mint 22.2
  - Kernel 6.14
  - Mesa 25.0.7
  - Proton 9.0-4
- Power plans are both set to `Power Saver`, which supplies about 24 Watt to the iGPU.
  - I do not like much noise. `Power Saver` mode does provide more stable gaming performance in my experience.

All FPS values are raw frame values measured by Steam overlay, without FSR addition. Benchmarks are running 1080P or 2K, with same graphic settings on both platforms.

### 2. Benchmark

#### 2.1 Crusader Kings III

[Crusader Kings III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/) provides Vulkan on Windows and Linux. All benchmarks are running 2K, middle quality preset.

- Windows Vulkan - 29 FPS

- Linux Vulkan - 40 FPS

- Graphic Settings

Linux gives much more FPS(~35%) than Windows.

#### 2.2 Victoria 3

[Victoria3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) provides DX11/Vulkan under Windows, and Vulkan under Linux. All benchmarks are running 2K, middle quality preset.

- Windows DX11 - 18 FPS

It's hard to tell which factor has the most influence on the gaming performance. Proton is becoming more and more mature, with almost no transplie penalty. All the 5 games give more FPS under Linux than Windows. Performance gains from 11% to 54%.

Two points to notice:

1. `Steam Deck` ships with AMD iGPU, much optimization may already be landed in kernel and graphic stacks.
2. Windows has more and more bloat these days. I am not sure whether a previous version like 24H2 or even Windows 10 will give a better performance. But the most important, Linux gives a more **stable** gaming experience. No popups, no sudden lags, no endless and useless updates. Everything is under your control.

I also benchmarked with `ntsync`-enabled Proton versions, almost no difference against the stock one.

Benchmarks may be machine-specific. If you have different gaming experience, comments are very welcome!
