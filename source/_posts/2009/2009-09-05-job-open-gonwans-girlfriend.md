Brief     I'm now working for ASUS Computer Inc. as a senior software engineer. My wage is about 5k - 8k per month. No house nor car is available.     In spare time, I read books. Learning is important. I also watch animes to relax myself. I like singing. My favorite singer is Fish Leong. Every week, I play badminton or do other sports.
